# Clustering_RJ_State_K-means
Final project of the MBA in Data Science and Analytics at USP. In this paper, I conducted a research titled "Mapping of the Rio de Janeiro State According to the Degree of Landslide Risk" where I identified through the machine learning technique named K-means the regions and cities more hit by this natural phenomenon.

Find below a summary of my paper ðŸ‘‡

Landslides are events that take place in a large part of Brazil and they are responsible for human, environmental, and material losses in the country every single year. This project aimed to map, at a municipality level, the Rio de Janeiro state regarding this sort of risk because it has been suffering from this phenomenon for decades. Studies about this natural event are essential to mitigate these losses as controlling the landslides is not something practicable in most cases due to their unpredictability. It was mainly collected data from public institutions to get information about Pluviosity, Geology, Geomorphology, Pedology, Vegetation, and Terrain Slope. The nonhierarchical clustering method, known as K-means, was applied in the creation of five different clusters concerning the risk of landslide. The project outcomes were presented through graphs and maps because a large amount of the data were geographical and they were deeply related to the natural aspects of the Rio de Janeiro state. Municipalities from RegiÃ£o Serrana and Costa Verde were more likely to be hit by this kind of phenomenon due to their physical and climatological characteristics. The Serra do Mar is closely connected to the landslides in the state as it has a high Terrain Slope and Pluviosity, and that made the municipalities, which are surrounded by it, presented a high risk. Some preventive measures, such as continuous monitoring, need to be conducted in these places and the government, along with the society, must work to create some prevention mechanisms in order to avoid other tragedies in Rio de Janeiro state.
